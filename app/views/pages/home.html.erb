        This is me and my fianc√©, Ana Marcela, the most beautiful woman ever created.
        The picture was taken on the 10th of august of the year 2024, when we
        got engaged, you know, when I asked her "the big question", haha.
        I made this page to test my knowledge and apply what I am currently learning
        from the Ruby on Rails framework and HTML, CSS and well, other web dev tools.
        Blessings to you all.
